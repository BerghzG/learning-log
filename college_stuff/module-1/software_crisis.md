# How Was The Software Crisis?

- The concept of Software Engineering was first proposed in 1965 during a conference that addressed the software crisis, which referred to the difficulties of software development failing to keep pace with advances in hardware technology.

- Hardware evolved significantly with the development of integrated circuits, enabling cost reduction and the miniaturization of components. In contrast, software began to be developed in an informal manner, often without the use of appropriate methodologies. This lack of organization and standardization contributed to the so-called software crisis, characterized by errors in systems, calculation problems, financial losses, and wasted time.
