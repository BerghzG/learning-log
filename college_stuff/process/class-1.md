## The Role of Processes in Business Strategy

Business processes are the mechanisms through which an organization executes its strategy. They transform the company’s vision, mission, and values into concrete actions. Rather than being simple operational routines, processes are strategic assets that generate competitive advantage.

Processes define how a company operates. They are responsible for producing the products and services delivered to customers and, ultimately, for creating value from the customer’s perspective. Well-structured processes differentiate successful organizations in competitive markets.

To ensure efficiency, roles and responsibilities within each department must be clearly defined and communicated. Activities should be objective, and workflows should be direct, logical, and streamlined.

Every organization performs a series of activities to achieve its objectives, such as:

- Processing purchase orders  
- Recruiting employees  
- Manufacturing products  
- Contracting suppliers  

Business professionals must understand how systems function, while IT professionals must understand how the business operates. This mutual understanding ensures that systems are designed to effectively support business process requirements.

## What Is a Business Process?

A business process is a complete and dynamically coordinated set of collaborative and transactional activities that delivers value to customers. In simple terms, it is the sequence of steps an organization performs to produce a product or deliver a service.

Identifying business processes is the first step in process management. However, this task can be complex because processes often span multiple departments and involve various professionals. This cross-functional nature can make it difficult to fully understand every step from beginning to end.

## AS-IS Processes

Once identified, a process must be mapped from start to finish to understand how it currently operates. This mapping is known as the **AS-IS process** (“as it is”).

The AS-IS methodology involves documenting the current state of the process, typically represented through a flowchart. This documentation provides a clear visualization of how activities are performed at the time of analysis.

During AS-IS mapping, organizations can identify:

- Operational problems  
- Bottlenecks and inefficiencies  
- Process weaknesses  
- Opportunities for improvement  

Common challenges during this phase include:

- Poorly defined requirements  
- Incomplete information  
- Lack of stakeholder engagement  
- Limited participation from process participants  

Careful analysis at this stage ensures an accurate representation of reality.

## TO-BE Processes

After analyzing and understanding the AS-IS process, it becomes easier to propose improvements and corrections.

The **TO-BE process** represents the optimized future version of the process. It incorporates improvements designed to eliminate inefficiencies, reduce delays, and increase overall effectiveness.

Both AS-IS and TO-BE processes are typically represented using flowcharts that illustrate:

- The stakeholders involved  
- The starting point of the process  
- The sequence of activities  
- Decision points  
- The completion of the process

## Business Process Management (BPM)

Business Process Management (BPM) is a management discipline focused on analyzing, improving, and optimizing business processes. It provides a structured approach to understanding how processes operate and how they can be enhanced to achieve better results.

## Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)

Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is the standardized notation used to model business processes within the BPM framework. It provides a visual language that improves communication between business and technical stakeholders.

BPMN includes specialized task types that clarify how activities are executed, particularly in automated environments. Examples include:

- **Service Task** – Executed automatically by a system  
- **Receive Task** – Waits for a message or input  
- **Send Task** – Sends a message or output  
- **User Task** – Performed by a person using a system  
- **Script Task** – Executed automatically via script  
- **Manual Task** – Performed without system support

## Tasks vs. Events

### Tasks

Tasks are activities performed during the process where the responsible actor is known. Examples include:

- Registering a product  
- Issuing an invoice  
- Approving a request  

In a sales process, for example, these tasks might be performed by a salesperson.

### Events

Events represent occurrences that affect the process flow. They may signal the beginning, interruption, or completion of a process.

By properly modeling and analyzing processes, organizations gain clarity on how they operate, identify inefficiencies, and continuously improve performance while delivering greater value to customers.
