# Learning Log - Analysis and Development of Systems (ADS)

This repository is a collection of my studies, notes, and practical exercises from the Analysis and Development of Systems (ADS) technologist program, which I started in mid-2025.

The goal of this Repository is to document my learning process, consolidate concepts, and track my technical growth over time. Here you will find summaries, explanations in my own words, and small practical examples related to the subjects studied during the course.

This is not a finished product, but an evolving learning log that reflects my progress as a student and aspiring developer.
