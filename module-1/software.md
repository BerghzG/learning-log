# What is Software?

- **Software** can be understood as a set of instructions that, when executed, provide resources, functionalities, and the expected performance of a system. It is what transforms the potential of hardware into something useful and applicable in everyday tasks, from simple actions to complex operations. 

- **Data structures** are essential because they allow programs to organize, store, and process information in a practical and efficient way. With them, it becomes possible to handle large volumes of data, perform quick searches, and ensure consistent results. 

- **Documentation** gathers detailed explanations, in both printed and digital formats, that guide users and developers. It describes how the programs work, how to install them, and how to use their features properly, while also serving as a reference for troubleshooting and maintenance.

## Basic System Software

- A collection of programs responsible for managing the computer’s operation and supporting the execution of other programs. The main example is the operating system, which controls the hardware and allows user interaction with the computer. Utility software or system tools are also part of the system, helping with maintenance and proper functioning.
Examples: Microsoft Windows, Android, macOS, and Linux.

## Utility Software

- Provides users with tools to manage and maintain the computer system. These tools help organize disks, check memory availability, and correct processing errors. They are essential for the proper functioning and maintenance of the computer system.
Examples: antivirus software, file compressors, emulators, disk defragmenters, formatting tools, and backup programs.

## Application Software

- Application software is a set of programs that help computer users perform specific tasks in their daily activities. These programs are commonly known as applications or apps.
Examples of application software include web browsers, word processors, spreadsheets, presentation software, DBMSs (Database Management Systems), image editors, and others.

## Operating System

**Operating system** is a type of **system software** responsible for managing the computer’s resources and enabling interaction between the user, the hardware, and application programs.

A **system** can be defined as a set of parts that interact with each other to achieve a specific objective.

What differentiates **system software** from other types of software is that it consists of a collection of programs that work together to control the operation of the computer and support the execution of application software.
