# What is Software?

- **Software** can be understood as a set of instructions that, when executed, provide resources, functionalities, and the expected performance of a system. It is what transforms the potential of hardware into something useful and applicable in everyday tasks, from simple actions to complex operations.

- **Data structures** are essential because they allow programs to organize, store, and process information in a practical and efficient way. With them, it becomes possible to handle large volumes of data, perform quick searches, and ensure consistent results.

- **Documentation** gathers detailed explanations, in both printed and digital formats, that guide users and developers. It describes how the programs work, how to install them, and how to use their features properly, while also serving as a reference for troubleshooting and maintenance.

## Basic System Software

- A collection of programs responsible for managing the computer’s operation and supporting the execution of other programs. The main example is the operating system, which controls the hardware and allows user interaction with the computer. Utility software or system tools are also part of the system, helping with maintenance and proper functioning.
Examples: Microsoft Windows, Android, macOS, and Linux.

## Utility Software

- Provides users with tools to manage and maintain the computer system. These tools help organize disks, check memory availability, and correct processing errors. They are essential for the proper functioning and maintenance of the computer system.
Examples: antivirus software, file compressors, emulators, disk defragmenters, formatting tools, and backup programs.

## Application Software

- Application software is a set of programs that help computer users perform specific tasks in their daily activities. These programs are commonly known as applications or apps.
Examples of application software include web browsers, word processors, spreadsheets, presentation software, DBMSs (Database Management Systems), image editors, and others.

## Operating System

- **Operating system** is a type of **system software** responsible for managing the computer’s resources and enabling interaction between the user, the hardware, and application programs.

- A **system** can be defined as a set of parts that interact with each other to achieve a specific objective. What differentiates **system software** from other types of software is that it consists of a collection of programs that work together to control the operation of the computer and support the execution of application software.

- A practical example of this functionality is **process management**. A process is a program that is currently being executed by the operating system. In Windows, the operating system allows the user to view and manage running processes through the Task Manager, which can be accessed by pressing **Ctrl + Shift + Esc**, **Ctrl + Alt + Del**, or by searching for “Task Manager” in the Windows search bar. Through this tool, the operating system enables monitoring and control of running applications and system resources, such as CPU and memory usage.

## Syntax VS Semantics

- Syntax and semantics are fundamental concepts in programming and computing in general. Syntax is related to the rules, assumptions, and constraints of a language. It defines **how symbols, words, and commands can be combined to form valid instructions**. In other words, syntax determines the correct way to write code or a statement.

- Semantics, on the other hand, refers to the content and meaning of these instructions. Even if a command is syntactically correct, it might not make sense from a semantic point of view, that is, it might not correctly represent the programmer's intention.

- There is also the so-called semantic gap, which represents the difference between programming logic and everyday logic. While humans interpret information in a flexible and contextual way, programming languages require precise instructions without ambiguities, following strict rules of syntax and semantics.

## Software Development Glossary

- In software development, applications are usually organized into layers and architectures that define how systems function and communicate. The front-end corresponds to the graphical and visual part of a web application, being responsible for direct interaction with the user, such as layout, colors, buttons, and animations. The back-end, on the other hand, represents the server side, where data processing, business logic, and communication with databases take place.

- When a professional works on both the front-end and the back-end, they are considered full-stack, as they operate across all layers of the application.

- Communication between systems is enabled through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), which are sets of rules, standards, and programming routines. APIs allow different applications to access each other’s functionalities, especially in web-based environments, promoting integration between software and services.

- During development, frameworks are commonly used. These consist of sets of code, libraries, and tools based on a specific programming language. They serve as the backbone of the application, providing ready-made structures and reusable functions that simplify, standardize, and accelerate the development of software and web applications.

- Regarding development approaches, applications can be native or hybrid. Native development targets a single platform, using its own languages and tools, such as Android Studio with Java or Kotlin for Android applications. In contrast, hybrid development uses technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with frameworks that allow a single codebase to generate applications that run on multiple platforms.

- Beyond the type of development, the system’s structure can also vary depending on the chosen architecture. In a monolithic architecture, the entire application runs as a single process, with all components tightly integrated. In a microservices architecture, the software is organized as a set of small, independent, autonomous, and specialized services. These services communicate with each other through well-defined APIs, making system maintenance, scalability, and evolution easier.

- In the context of communication between services, there are different standards and protocols. SOAP (Service-Oriented Architecture Protocol) is a protocol used for exchanging messages between systems, based on XML files and usually transported via HTTPS. Another widely used approach is REST (Representational State Transfer), which is not a protocol but rather a set of architectural constraints for building web services.

- When a service follows these constraints, it is called RESTful. RESTful services typically use HTTPS as the transport protocol and exchange data in JSON format, as it is lighter and easier to read compared to XML.

- During development, the use of code control practices is also essential. A commit represents the submission and recording of changes made to a specific piece of code, marking the creation of a new version of the project. This process allows tracking the evolution of the software over time.

- Related to this, versioning consists of assigning numbers or version identifiers to each state of the project, making it easier to control modifications. A simple example of versioning is organizing the project into folders with different versions, such as trabalho_fds_v1, trabalho_fds_v2, and so on.

- Finally, the term services refers to software processes in execution. In this context, a software process is not related to the set of activities in software engineering, but rather to a program that is being executed and managed by the operating system.
